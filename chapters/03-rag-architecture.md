# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Architecture

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a cornerstone architecture for production LLM applications, enabling models to access and reason over private, current, or specialized knowledge. This chapter explores RAG architecture patterns, components, and best practices.

## Core RAG Architecture

The fundamental RAG process consists of five key components:

![RAG Architecture](/assets/images/rag-architecture.png)

1. **Document Processing Pipeline**
   - Document ingestion from multiple sources
   - Text extraction and cleaning
   - Chunking strategies
   - Metadata enrichment

2. **Embedding Generation**
   - Embedding model selection
   - Vector representation creation
   - Dimensionality considerations
   - Batch processing strategies

3. **Vector Database**
   - Vector store selection and configuration
   - Indexing approaches
   - Metadata filtering capabilities
   - Scaling considerations

4. **Retrieval Component**
   - Query processing
   - Semantic search execution
   - Relevance ranking
   - Result filtering

5. **Generation with Context**
   - Prompt construction with retrieved content
   - Context integration strategies
   - Response synthesis
   - Citation and attribution

## Advanced RAG Design Patterns

### 1. Multi-Stage Retrieval

```
[Query] → [Initial Retrieval] → [Results Reranking] → [LLM Generation]
```

This pattern introduces a reranking step that applies more sophisticated relevance criteria after initial retrieval, significantly improving result quality. Reranking can use:

- Cross-encoders for pair-wise relevance scoring
- Query-specific filtering criteria
- LLM-based relevance assessment
- Hybrid keyword + semantic ranking

### 2. Query Transformation

```
[Original Query] → [Query Expansion/Reformulation] → [Retrieval] → [LLM Generation]
```

This pattern addresses the "lexical gap" between user queries and documents by:

- Expanding queries with synonyms or related terms
- Reformulating queries for optimal retrieval
- Generating multiple search queries from a single user question
- Creating structured queries with metadata filters

### 3. Recursive Retrieval

```
[Query] → [Initial Retrieval] → [LLM Processing] → [Follow-up Queries] → [Additional Retrieval] → [Final Generation]
```

This pattern enables multi-hop reasoning by:
- Analyzing initial results to identify information gaps
- Generating follow-up queries to fill those gaps
- Building a comprehensive context through multiple retrieval rounds
- Synthesizing across multiple retrieved contexts

### 4. Hypothetical Document Retrieval (HyDE)

```
[Query] → [Generate Hypothetical Answer] → [Use as Retrieval Query] → [Actual Retrieval] → [LLM Generation]
```

This innovative pattern:
- Has the LLM generate a hypothetical document that would answer the query
- Uses this hypothetical document as the retrieval query
- Often improves retrieval of relevant content for complex queries

## Vector Database Selection Criteria

| Feature | Why It Matters | Example Technologies |
|---------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Query Speed** | Affects response time | Pinecone, Qdrant, Weaviate |
| **Filtering Capabilities** | Enables precise retrieval | Weaviate, Pinecone, Milvus |
| **Scaling Model** | Affects cost and performance | Pinecone (serverless), Milvus (distributed) |
| **Metadata Support** | Enables hybrid search | Qdrant, Weaviate, Chroma |
| **Update Capabilities** | Affects data freshness | Most modern vector DBs |
| **Cloud vs. Self-hosted** | Deployment flexibility | Pinecone (cloud), Qdrant (both) |
| **Similarity Metrics** | Affects retrieval quality | Cosine, Euclidean, Dot product |

## Chunking Strategies

Document chunking significantly impacts retrieval quality:

### Fixed-Size Chunking
- **Approach**: Break documents into chunks of consistent token/character length
- **Pros**: Simple implementation, consistent processing
- **Cons**: May split semantic units, context loss at boundaries

### Semantic Chunking
- **Approach**: Break documents at natural semantic boundaries (paragraphs, sections)
- **Pros**: Preserves semantic unity, more natural retrieval units
- **Cons**: Variable chunk sizes may affect retrieval consistency

### Hierarchical Chunking
- **Approach**: Create multiple granularity levels (document → section → paragraph)
- **Pros**: Enables multi-level retrieval, preserves broader context
- **Cons**: More complex implementation, storage overhead

### Sliding Window with Overlap
- **Approach**: Create overlapping chunks to preserve context across boundaries
- **Pros**: Reduces information loss at chunk boundaries
- **Cons**: Storage overhead, potential duplication in results

## RAG Evaluation Framework

Effective RAG systems require evaluation across multiple dimensions:

### 1. Retrieval Quality Metrics
- **Recall@k**: Proportion of relevant documents retrieved in top k results
- **Precision@k**: Proportion of top k retrieved documents that are relevant
- **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)**: Position of first relevant document
- **Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)**: Relevance-weighted ranking metric

### 2. Generation Quality Metrics
- **Faithfulness**: How well the generated content reflects retrieved information
- **Answer Relevance**: How well the answer addresses the question
- **Citation Accuracy**: Whether citations correctly map to source material
- **Hallucination Rate**: Frequency of made-up information not in retrieved content

### 3. End-to-End Evaluation
- **Task Completion Rate**: Whether users can accomplish their tasks
- **Time to Answer**: Total time from query to usable response
- **User Satisfaction**: Subjective evaluation of response quality
- **Error Rate**: Frequency of problematic responses

## Performance Optimization Techniques

### 1. Embedding Optimization
- Embedding model selection for domain specificity
- Dimensionality reduction techniques
- Quantization for storage efficiency
- Batched processing for throughput

### 2. Vector Database Optimization
- Appropriate index selection (HNSW, IVF, etc.)
- Caching strategies for frequent queries
- Sharding approaches for large collections
- Hardware acceleration (GPU/SIMD)

### 3. Retrieval Strategy Optimization
- Dynamic k selection based on query characteristics
- Hybrid search (vector + keyword + metadata)
- Query routing to specialized indices
- Context-aware filtering

### 4. Generation Optimization
- Dynamic prompt construction based on retrieved content
- Strategic context placement within prompts
- Streaming responses to improve perceived latency
- Response caching for common queries

By implementing these advanced RAG patterns and optimization techniques, AI architects can build production-grade knowledge-enabled LLM applications that deliver reliable, accurate, and contextually relevant responses.
