*Estimates are illustrative; actual costs depend on specific use cases, optimization, and deployment choices.*

## Hybrid and Multi-Model Architectures

Many successful architectures leverage multiple models:

### Common Hybrid Patterns

1. **Tiered Service Levels**: 
   - Lower-tier: Self-hosted OSS models
   - Premium-tier: API models with higher capabilities

2. **Task-Specific Routing**:
   - Reasoning tasks: More capable API models
   - Generation tasks: Efficient OSS models
   - Classification tasks: Fine-tuned specialists

3. **Fallback Architectures**:
   - Primary: Self-hosted for most traffic
   - Backup: APIs for overflow or when self-hosted is unavailable

4. **Staged Processing**:
   - Initial processing: Smaller, efficient OSS models
   - Complex reasoning: Larger, more capable models

### Architectural Considerations for Multi-Model Systems

When designing for multiple models:

- **Abstraction Layer**: Isolate application logic from specific model interfaces
- **Model Routing**: Define clear criteria for which model handles which requests
- **Unified Evaluation**: Consistent performance metrics across models
- **Prompt Standardization**: Normalize instructions across different model capabilities
- **Response Normalization**: Standardize outputs from different models
