# Chapter 0: Stakeholder Alignment & Requirement Gathering

## Introduction: The Critical Foundation of LLM Projects

Successful LLM application architectures begin well before any technical decisions are made. This chapter addresses the crucial initial phase of aligning stakeholders and gathering requirementsâ€”a process that differs significantly for LLM-based systems compared to traditional software applications. The unique capabilities and limitations of LLMs, and especially AI agents, require a specialized approach to discovering, articulating, and prioritizing requirements.

As AI Architects, we often encounter scenarios where stakeholders have widely divergent understandings of what LLMs can and cannot do. Executive sponsors may have been captivated by demos of consumer AI tools but lack understanding of enterprise integration challenges. End users might fear job displacement while simultaneously underestimating the human expertise still required for effective AI collaboration. This chapter provides concrete approaches to navigate these complexities from the very outset of your project.

## Objectives of This Chapter

By the end of this chapter, AI Architects will be able to:

1. Lead effective stakeholder alignment sessions specifically tailored for LLM projects
2. Identify and document LLM-specific requirements that go beyond traditional software specifications
3. Create a shared understanding of possibilities and limitations with non-technical stakeholders
4. Develop realistic success criteria that balance ambition with the current state of the technology
5. Establish a foundation for responsible AI governance from project inception
6. Apply practical tools and templates for LLM-specific requirements gathering
7. Recognize and mitigate common pitfalls in early-stage LLM projects

## The Stakeholder Landscape for LLM Projects

### Key Stakeholders and Their Concerns

| Stakeholder Type | Primary Concerns | How to Engage | Common Misconceptions to Address |
|------------------|------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| Executive Sponsors | Business impact, ROI, competitive advantage | Focus on measurable outcomes and industry benchmarking | "AI will magically solve all problems"; "We can replace entire departments" |
| End Users | Usability, trust, integration with workflows | Co-design sessions, journey mapping, prototype testing | "The AI will take my job"; "I need to become a prompt engineer" |
| Subject Matter Experts | Knowledge accuracy, domain alignment | Knowledge extraction workshops, validation frameworks | "The AI can't possibly understand our domain"; "Our knowledge is too specialized" |
| Legal/Compliance | Risk management, data privacy, industry regulations | Early involvement in requirement specification | "AI is too risky for our regulated industry"; "We can't control what it might say" |
| IT/Security | Integration, scalability, information security | Technical discovery sessions, threat modeling | "LLMs require completely new infrastructure"; "We can't secure these systems" |
| Model/AI Teams | Model selection, performance criteria | Capability assessment workshops, tradeoff analysis | "We need the most powerful model for everything"; "Fine-tuning will solve all problems" |
| Finance | Cost predictability, budget allocation | Cost modeling workshops, staged investment planning | "AI costs are unpredictable"; "This is just another IT project" |
| Operations | Maintainability, support processes | Operational readiness planning, support model design | "AI systems are self-maintaining"; "We can't troubleshoot these systems" |

### Common Stakeholder Misalignments in LLM Projects

1. **Capability Expectations Gap**: Executives often overestimate capabilities based on consumer AI experiences
   * *Example*: A CEO who uses ChatGPT may insist that your enterprise LLM system should be able to autonomously generate the company's annual strategy with minimal input.
   * *Mitigation*: Structured capability demonstrations showing both strengths and limitations, with concrete enterprise examples.

2. **Responsibility Attribution**: Unclear ownership of outputs when AI becomes more autonomous
   * *Example*: When an LLM system generates inaccurate financial advice, disagreements emerge about whether responsibility lies with the model provider, the implementation team, or the business unit.
   * *Mitigation*: Develop clear RACI matrices for AI outputs and decisions early in the project.

3. **Performance Definition**: Different metrics matter to different stakeholders (accuracy vs. latency vs. cost)
   * *Example*: Customer service prioritizes response quality, while operations focuses on throughput and cost per interaction.
   * *Mitigation*: Multi-dimensional success metrics with explicit prioritization for different contexts.

4. **Risk Tolerance**: Varying comfort levels with probabilistic systems and potential failures
   * *Example*: Legal teams may require 100% accuracy for regulatory statements, while marketing accepts creative variation.
   * *Mitigation*: Risk categorization frameworks with different handling strategies for each category.

5. **Implementation Timeline**: Different expectations on deployment speed and iterative improvement
   * *Example*: Business leaders expect full deployment after seeing a prototype, while technical teams understand the need for extensive testing and refinement.
   * *Mitigation*: Staged rollout plans with clear milestones and decision gates.

### Stakeholder Alignment Workshop Structure

## LLM-Specific Requirement Gathering Techniques

### Beyond Traditional Requirement Specifications

Traditional requirement gathering often falls short for LLM applications because:

- Requirements are more qualitative and subjective ("natural-sounding responses")
- Deterministic specifications clash with probabilistic systems
- User needs and expectations evolve through interaction with the system
- The range of possible inputs and outputs is virtually infinite
- Traditional testing methodologies cannot cover all possible interactions
- Acceptance criteria must accommodate reasonable variance in outputs
- Edge cases are difficult to anticipate and explicitly specify

### The LLM Requirements Canvas

Our LLM Requirements Canvas provides a structured framework for capturing the unique dimensions of LLM application requirements:

1. **Task Boundaries**: What the system should and should not attempt to do
   * *Specific Areas to Define*:
     * Core capabilities to be provided
     * Explicitly out-of-scope functions
     * Escalation triggers for human intervention
     * Edge case handling approaches

2. **Information Access**: What data the system needs and is permitted to access
   * *Specific Areas to Define*:
     * Required knowledge sources
     * Permissioning and data sensitivity levels
     * Freshness requirements
     * Prohibited information sources or topics

3. **Interaction Patterns**: How users and agents will communicate and collaborate
   * *Specific Areas to Define*:
     * Communication channels and modes
     * Turn-taking protocols
     * Collaboration workflows
     * Handoff mechanisms between AI and humans

4. **Performance Thresholds**: Minimum acceptable standards across multiple dimensions
   * *Specific Areas to Define*:
     * Response time expectations
     * Quality acceptance criteria
     * Accuracy requirements by task type
     * Resource utilization limits

5. **Safety Guardrails**: Explicit constraints on system behavior
   * *Specific Areas to Define*:
     * Content filtering parameters
     * Ethical boundaries
     * Regulatory compliance requirements
     * Security controls

6. **Quality Attributes**: Specific emphasis on controllability, explainability, and alignment
   * *Specific Areas to Define*:
     * Explainability mechanisms
     * Uncertainty communication approaches
     * Feedback incorporation methods
     * Trust-building features

## Practical Requirements Documentation for LLM Systems

### The LLM User Story Format

Standard user stories often need adaptation for LLM systems. We recommend:

```
As a [user role], 
I want the system to [capability], 
with [specific quality attributes], 
even when [challenging conditions], 
but never [boundaries/constraints].
```

**Example**:
```
As a financial analyst,
I want the system to summarize quarterly earnings reports,
with accuracy in numerical data and key trend identification,
even when the reports use varying terminology and structures,
but never making speculative financial advice or predictions.
```

**Additional Examples**:

```
As a customer support agent,
I want the system to suggest responses to customer inquiries,
with appropriate tone and relevant product information,
even when dealing with multiple issues in a single message,
but never committing to specific delivery dates or policy exceptions.
```

```
As a marketing copywriter,
I want the system to generate variant headlines for A/B testing,
with consistent brand voice and compelling value propositions,
even when targeting different customer segments,
but never using hyperbole or making unsubstantiated claims.
```

```
As a clinical researcher,
I want the system to identify relevant studies for literature review,
with accurate citation information and methodology summaries,
even when searching across interdisciplinary boundaries,
but never misrepresenting statistical significance or clinical outcomes.
```

### Documenting Agentic System Requirements

   * **Challenge**: Diverse stakeholders including partners, associates, paralegals, IT, clients, and compliance
   * **Approach**: Series of role-focused workshops followed by cross-functional alignment sessions
   * **Outcome**: Comprehensive stakeholder map with influence/interest matrix guiding engagement priorities

2. Key misalignments discovered in early workshops
   * **Partners**: Concerned about confidentiality and work product quality
   * **Associates**: Worried about training opportunities and job security
   * **IT**: Focused on integration with document management systems
   * **Clients**: Eager for cost reductions but concerned about accuracy
   * **Resolution Approach**: Capability demos calibrated to each group's concerns, followed by joint vision workshops

3. How requirements evolved through prototype demonstrations
   * **Initial Requirements**: Basic document summarization and clause extraction
   * **Evolution**: Addition of explanation features, precedent linking, and confidence scoring
   * **Key Learning**: Interactive prototyping revealed unstated needs around explainability and verification

4. The final capability specification and success criteria
   * **Core Capabilities**: Document analysis, clause extraction, risk identification, precedent linking
   * **Success Metrics**: 40% time reduction in document review, 95% accuracy on key clause identification
   * **Governance Requirements**: Full audit trail, confidence scoring, human verification workflow

5. Measured outcomes showing the impact of proper alignment
   * **Business Impact**: 43% time savings, improved consistency, higher associate satisfaction
   * **Implementation Success**: On-time delivery, 92% user adoption in first month
   * **Key Alignment Factor**: Early involvement of all stakeholder groups created shared ownership

### Lessons Learned

1. Partner involvement from day one was critical for addressing confidentiality concerns
2. Framing the system as "augmentation" rather than "automation" helped address job security fears
3. Client inclusion in requirements workshops uncovered unexpected use cases
4. Progressive prototyping with all stakeholder groups prevented late-stage requirement changes
5. Explicit documentation of what the system would NOT do was as important as capability definitions

## Decision Framework: Requirement Prioritization Matrix for LLM Projects

When prioritizing requirements for LLM applications, consider these dimensions:
