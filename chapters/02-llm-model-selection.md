# LLM Model Selection & Evaluation

Selecting the right LLM for your application is a critical architectural decision with far-reaching implications for cost, performance, security, and compliance. This chapter provides frameworks for evaluating and selecting appropriate models.

## The Model Selection Decision Tree

Model selection requires balancing multiple dimensions. Start with these key questions:

![Model Selection Decision Tree](/assets/images/model-selection-tree.png)

1. **Deployment Environment**
   - Does the model need to run in a self-hosted environment?
   - Are there data privacy requirements prohibiting external API calls?
   - Is offline capability required?

2. **Task Complexity**
   - What level of reasoning capabilities are required?
   - Is specialized domain knowledge needed?
   - Will the application require multi-step planning?

3. **Resource Constraints**
   - What are the latency requirements?
   - What is the expected query volume?
   - What is the cost sensitivity?

## API Models vs. Open Source Models

| Dimension | API Models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) | Open Source Models (e.g., Llama, Mistral) |
|-----------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Setup Complexity** | Low (API integration only) | High (hosting infrastructure required) |
| **Operational Costs** | Usage-based pricing | Infrastructure and maintenance costs |
| **Performance** | Generally higher capabilities | Varies by model size and type |
| **Customization** | Limited to prompt engineering | Fine-tuning and adaptation possible |
| **Data Privacy** | Data may leave your environment | Can be deployed in private environments |
| **Scaling** | Handled by provider | Must be managed by your team |
| **Compliance** | Dependent on provider contracts | Dependent on deployment architecture |

## Quantitative Model Evaluation Framework

Develop a scoring system based on the following metrics:

### 1. Performance Metrics
- **Task-specific accuracy**: Measured on relevant benchmarks
- **Hallucination rate**: Frequency of made-up information
- **Robustness**: Performance across different inputs
- **Context window**: Maximum input length

### 2. Operational Metrics
- **Inference latency**: Time to generate responses
- **Token throughput**: Tokens processed per second
- **Cost per query**: Direct or infrastructure costs
- **Scaling behavior**: Performance under load

### 3. Integration Metrics
- **API simplicity**: Ease of integration
- **Documentation quality**: Completeness of documentation
- **Community support**: Available resources and help
- **Version stability**: Frequency of breaking changes

## Model Capability Testing Protocol

For each candidate model, create a standardized testing protocol:

1. **Basic Capability Tests**
   - Instructions following
   - Reading comprehension
   - Text summarization
   - Basic reasoning

2. **Domain-Specific Tests**
   - Industry terminology comprehension
   - Domain knowledge accuracy
   - Specialized formats handling
   - Professional language quality

3. **Edge Case Tests**
   - Ambiguous instructions
   - Error recovery
   - Adversarial inputs
   - Capability boundaries

## Self-Hosting Considerations

If considering self-hosted models, evaluate these additional factors:

1. **Infrastructure Requirements**
   - GPU specifications and availability
   - Memory and storage needs
   - Networking configuration
   - Scaling architecture

2. **Optimization Techniques**
   - Quantization options (4-bit, 8-bit)
   - Model pruning capabilities
   - Inference optimization libraries
   - Caching strategies

3. **Maintenance Planning**
   - Model update frequency
   - Monitoring requirements
   - Performance tuning needs
   - Backup and redundancy

## Multi-Model Architecture Pattern

Consider implementing a multi-model architecture where different tasks leverage different models:

```
[User Query] → [Router] → [Task Classification]
                   ↓
   ┌───────────┬───────────┬───────────┐
   ↓           ↓           ↓           ↓
[Small Model] [Medium Model] [Large Model] [Specialized Model]
   ↓           ↓           ↓           ↓
   └───────────┴───────────┴───────────┘
                   ↓
               [Response]
```

Benefits of this approach include:
- Cost optimization (using smaller models where possible)
- Performance optimization (faster responses for simpler tasks)
- Capability maximization (specialized models for specific domains)

## Model Evaluation Scorecard Template

| Criterion | Weight | Model A | Model B | Model C |
|-----------|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Task Accuracy** | 25% | | | |
| **Response Quality** | 20% | | | |
| **Latency** | 15% | | | |
| **Cost** | 15% | | | |
| **Security & Compliance** | 15% | | | |
| **Implementation Effort** | 10% | | | |
| **TOTAL** | 100% | | | |

By systematically evaluating models across these dimensions, AI architects can make informed decisions that balance capability, cost, and operational requirements for their specific use case.
