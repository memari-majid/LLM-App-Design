# About This Guide

The LLM Application-Architecture Design guide was created to address the unique challenges faced by architects and developers working with Large Language Models. As LLM applications move from experimental prototypes to mission-critical production systems, the need for robust architectural patterns becomes increasingly important.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to provide a practical, comprehensive resource that bridges the gap between traditional software architecture and the emerging field of LLM application design. We believe that successful LLM applications require thoughtful architecture that balances innovation with enterprise-grade reliability, security, and governance.

## Contributors

This guide is maintained by a community of AI architects, solution engineers, and practitioners working on the frontlines of LLM application development. We welcome contributions from all who share our passion for building better AI systems.
