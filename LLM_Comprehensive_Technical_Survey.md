> **Version 0.1 – Framework Draft**  
> This document is being developed using a top-down strategy:  
> 1. Define the full structure and key subsection headings.  
> 2. Populate each section with concise bullet-point summaries of the core topics to be elaborated.  
> 3. Iteratively expand each section with in-depth technical details, figures, and references.

### Planned Expansion Workflow
1. **Fill Abstract and Introduction** with concise text.  
2. **Iteratively enrich Sections 2–4** (architectures, training, fine-tuning).  
3. **Detail evaluation metrics and benchmarks** in Section 6.  
4. **Populate multi-agent and specialized application sections** with case studies.  
5. Finalize deployment, ethical, and future work discussions.  
6. Add comprehensive references and cross-links.
