## 1  Scope & Positioning

| Item | Decision |
|------|----------|
| **Audience** | Senior engineers, software/ML architects, DevOps/SRE leads, product managers building *production* LLM systems. |
| **Goal** | Deliver canonical architectural patterns, design checklists, and real-world practices for reliable, scalable, cost-efficient, and compliant LLM applications. |
| **Depth** | Hands-on: diagrams, Terraform/K8s/YAML snippets, LangGraph code, evaluation notebooks. |
| **Framing** | Vendor-neutral; deep dives on LangChain family (LangGraph/LangSmith) as reference tooling. |

## 3  Writing & Production Roadmap

| Phase | Duration | Deliverables |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| **P0  Kick-off** | 1 week | Finalised ToC, style guide, repo scaffolding. |
| **P1  Rapid Skeleton Draft** | 4 weeks | "Code + bullets" outline for every chapter. |
| **P2  Deep-Dive Drafts** | 8 weeks | Full prose, diagrams, case-study repos. |
| **P3  Technical Review** | 3 weeks | SME review, security red-team. |
| **P4  Alpha Release** | 2 weeks | Early-access PDF/HTML, feedback via GitHub Issues. |
| **P5  Polish & Production** | 4 weeks | Copy-edit, layout, index, final build. |
| **Launch** | — | Print-on-demand + ePub; companion repo OSS. |

Every merge to `main` triggers CI to build HTML & PDF preview via GitHub Actions.

## 4  Support Assets

1. **GitHub Repository** `llm-app-arch-book`  
   • `/chapters/`, `/figures/`, `/examples/`, `/infra/terraform`  
2. **Dev-Container** – Dockerfile + VS Code context for repeatable builds.  
3. **Diagram Toolkit** – Mermaid + PlantUML template files.  
4. **Issue Templates** – *errata*, *feature-request*, *code-bug*.  

---

## 5  Style & Pedagogy Guidelines

* Pattern–Anti-pattern pairs for each core component.  
* Call-out boxes: _Latency Gotcha_, _Cost-Saver_, _Security Alert_.  
* End-of-chapter checklists reproducible in real projects.  
* QR links to live LangGraph playgrounds and monitoring dashboards.
